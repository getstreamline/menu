# @getstreamline/menu

This is a jQuery library that provides responsive and accessible behaviors for top and left navigation menus. Responsive because it automatically adjusts behavior based on the menu orientation as it changes based on your CSS styling and breakpoints. Accessible because it follows the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/) design patterns for menus w/ roving focus and keyboard navigation.

See `index.html` for an example.
